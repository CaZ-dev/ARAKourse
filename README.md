When you open the app after the flash screeen, we see the Homescreen.
Courses displayed on the Homescreen are based on the popularity and are from random categories.

Here the user can search for any of their desired course.The search bar works on the principle of identifying the key words and gives results of the course related to it.

If the user wants to see the course in detail and want to buy it, he/she will simply click on the show me more button which will redirect the user to udemy's website link for the particular course.
